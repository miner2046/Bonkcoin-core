Friccoin is a community focused cryptocurrency. It was created for one purpose, to create a new and fun community just like the original Dogecoin community.

Unlike all iterations before it, Friccoin is a layer 1 coin. This means there are no liquidity pools to drain, no blacklisting wallets, and no confusing smart contracts. Friccoin is a simple blockchain.

The Friccoin Core software allows anyone to operate a node in the Friccoin blockchain networks and uses the Scrypt hashing method for Proof of Work. It is adapted from Dogecoin Core, Bitcoin Core, and other cryptocurrencies.

For information about the default fees used on the Friccoin network, please
refer to the [fee recommendation](doc/fee-recommendation.md).

## Usage 💻

To start your journey with Friccoin Core, see the [installation guide](INSTALL.md) and the [getting started](doc/getting-started.md) tutorial.

The JSON-RPC API provided by Friccoin Core is self-documenting and can be browsed with `friccoin-cli help`, while detailed information for each command can be viewed with `friccoin-cli help <command>`. Alternatively, see the [Bitcoin Core documentation](https://developer.bitcoin.org/reference/rpc/) - which implement a similar protocol - to get a browsable version.

### Ports

Friccoin Core by default uses port `14327` for peer-to-peer communication that
is needed to synchronize the "mainnet" blockchain and stay informed of new
transactions and blocks. Additionally, a JSONRPC port can be opened, which
defaults to port `15612` for mainnet nodes. It is strongly recommended to not
expose RPC ports to the public internet.

| Function | mainnet | testnet | regtest |
| :------- | ------: | ------: | ------: |
| P2P      |   14327 |   14328 |   14329 |
| RPC      |   15612 |   15613 |   15614 |
