Bonkcoin Core [BONC]
</h1>


BonkCoin introduces an innovative world of meme-inspired cryptocurrency, blending humor with blockchain technology. It is created to bring joy, entertainment, and interaction to the crypto community. Operating on a decentralized, community-focused ecosystem, BonkCoin seeks to merge the excitement of memes with the advancements of blockchain.

Unlike all iterations before it, Bonkcoin is a layer 1 coin. This means there are no liquidity pools to drain, no blacklisting wallets, and no confusing smart contracts. Bonkcoin is a simple blockchain.

The Bonkcoin Core software allows anyone to operate a node in the Bonkcoin blockchain networks and uses the Scrypt hashing method for Proof of Work. It is adapted from Dogecoin Core, Bitcoin Core, and other cryptocurrencies.

For information about the default fees used on the Bonkcoin network, please
refer to the [fee recommendation](doc/fee-recommendation.md).

To start your journey with Bonkcoin Core, see the [installation guide](INSTALL.md) and the [getting started](doc/getting-started.md) tutorial.

The JSON-RPC API provided by Bonkcoin Core is self-documenting and can be browsed with `bonkcoin-cli help`, while detailed information for each command can be viewed with `bonkcoin-cli help <command>`.

### Ports

Bonkcoin Core by default uses port `14327` for peer-to-peer communication that
is needed to synchronize the "mainnet" blockchain and stay informed of new
transactions and blocks. Additionally, a JSONRPC port can be opened, which
defaults to port `15612` for mainnet nodes. It is strongly recommended to not
expose RPC ports to the public internet.

| Function | mainnet | testnet | regtest |
| :------- | ------: | ------: | ------: |
| P2P      |   14327 |   44874 |   18444 |
| RPC      |   15612 |   44873 |   18332 |
