## Frequently Asked Questions ❓

### How much Friccoin can exist?

In the first 600,000 blocks (about 1 year and 2 months) 100 billion Friccoin will be mined. After this, every block will award 10,000 Friccoin. At one block per minute this equates to an additional ~5.25 billion Friccoin per year. Because a flat amount of new coins are mined, Friccoin inflates less each year.

Inflation = ~5.25 Billion/TotalSupply

Since TotalSupply increases each year, inflation decreases.

### Mining information ⛏

Friccoin uses a simplified variant of the scrypt key derivation function as its
proof of work with a target time of one minute per block and difficulty
readjustment after every block. The block rewards are fixed and halve every
100,000 blocks. Starting with the 600,000th block, a permanent reward of
10,000 Friccoin per block will be issued.

Reasoning from Dogecoin:

>Originally, a different payout scheme was envisioned with block rewards being
determined by taking the maximum reward as per the block schedule and applying
the result of a Mersenne Twister pseudo-random number generator to arrive at a
number between 0 and the maximum reward.<br>
This was changed starting with block 145,000, to prevent large pools from gaming
the system and mining only high reward blocks. At the same time, the difficulty
retargeting was also changed from four hours to once per block (every minute),
implementing an algorithm courtesy of the DigiByte Coin development team, to
lessen the impact of sudden increases and decreases of network hashing rate.


**The current block reward schedule:**

| Block                | Reward in Friccoin |
| :------------------- | -----------------: |
| 1–99,999             |            500,000 |
| 100,000–199,999      |            250,000 |
| 200,000–299,999      |            125,000 |
| 300,000–399,999      |             62,500 |
| 400,000–499,999      |             31,250 |
| 500,000–599,999      |             15,625 |
| 600,000+             |             10,000 |
